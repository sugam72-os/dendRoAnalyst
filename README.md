There are various functions for managing and cleaning data before the application of different approaches. This includes  identifying and erasing sudden jumps in dendrometer data not related to environmental change, identifying the time gaps of    recordings, and changes in the resolution of data due to different temporal resolutions. Furthermore, the package calculates daily statistics of dendrometer data, including the daily amplitude of tree growth. Both SC and ZG approaches are used to separate radial growth from daily cyclic shrinkage and expansion due to uptake and loss of stem water. In addition, it identifies periods of consecutive days with user-defined climatic conditions in daily meteorological data, then check what trees are doing during that period.
